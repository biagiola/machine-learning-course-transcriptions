00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
<v Instructor>Hello, everybody.</v>

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.690
Welcome to the machine learning crash course

3
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.570
prerequisites video. Here, the idea is to give you some idea

4
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.460
of what background could be useful

5
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.510
before we begin the machine learning crash course.

6
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.024
Now, if your goal is to just become conversational

7
00:00:15.024 --> 00:00:18.140
in machine learning, then I wouldn't focus too much

8
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.780
on the concepts in this video.

9
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.670
However, if your goal is to interview for

10
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.940
a technical ML based role then it will be really helpful

11
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.710
to know these things to help you grasp the math

12
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.880
behind the models. So first let's go over some terminology

13
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.610
generally models we'll take in features.

14
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.550
An example of features is what we saw

15
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.970
in the introduction video which had the price

16
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.980
of Bitcoin organized by each month.

17
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.200
Features are generally observations that can be continuous

18
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.558
such as the price of Bitcoin. It could be categorical such

19
00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:49.960
as the label that we had for Bitcoin

20
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.920
which is either up or down, and it can also be ordinal.

21
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.960
This is the case where it's a category but

22
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.240
it can be ordered. This could be something like small

23
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.760
medium and large. Features are useful

24
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.360
when we want to predict something of interest.

25
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.410
Features are generally paired with labels.

26
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.980
Like we mentioned earlier, the label that we used

27
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.100
in the Bitcoin example was a directional indicator

28
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.440
of up or down. That would be a categorical label.

29
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.090
However, labels can also take on

30
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.820
continuous variables as well as ordinal.

31
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.440
Labels are generally something

32
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.020
that's going to be useful that we want to know.

33
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.244
Now, examples are pairs of features and labels.

34
00:01:27.244 --> 00:01:29.544
Examples are typically going to be used

35
00:01:29.544 --> 00:01:32.870
in a supervised model. Unsupervised models

36
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.456
will not have the label. Now in terms of math,

37
00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:39.296
we'll be going over concepts such as arrays or vectors.

38
00:01:39.296 --> 00:01:42.340
In this case, an array is just a feature

39
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.773
which has been transformed to a list of values.

40
00:01:45.773 --> 00:01:48.620
These could be words as well as numbers.

41
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.210
Now, these factors can be assigned

42
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.670
to some variable in our case, I'll be using x-bar a lot.

43
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.410
The bar just indicates that it is in fact a vector

44
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.380
and each element in the vector will be called

45
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.920
x one, x two, x three, x four,

46
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.750
and so on for how many of our values are in the vector.

47
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.520
Now, in some cases, what you'll see me do is select a couple

48
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.060
of these elements in the vector and actually plot them out.

49
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.500
So we could have x one on this axis, x two on this axis.

50
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.500
And if we plot 29.3 K and 33.5 K together on these axis

51
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.490
we would have a point right here.

52
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.950
Again, this is just plotting a vector that we have.

53
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.757
Now next we can have a two dimensional array

54
00:02:30.757 --> 00:02:33.000
and that will give us a matrix.

55
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.050
So for instance, this is a matrix

56
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.740
and I'll generally assign a variable to some capital letter.

57
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.510
So here, this matrix could be A, and that could be matrix B.

58
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.780
Now, once we have these two matrices

59
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.550
what we can do is a matrix multiplication

60
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.490
that will look something like this.

61
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.060
Now, if we just have a single matrix, we can do the inverse

62
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.810
of a matrix that would be notated like this.

63
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.920
And then finally, we can transpose a single matrix.

64
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.900
Now we don't often use these across the crash course

65
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.040
but we do use them a couple of times.

66
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.790
So I just want to let you know that we will see them,

67
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.890
as well, in a couple of videos, we'll be talking

68
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.850
about polynomials. Now specifically, we'll be talking

69
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.980
about lines. This is just the equation of a line.

70
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.810
We'll also be talking about quadratics.

71
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.020
So here's an example of that, but in general

72
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.370
we'll only be talking about polynomials a couple of times.

73
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.758
Finally, we're going to have to take the derivative

74
00:03:24.758 --> 00:03:28.780
of these polynomials for some of the advanced

75
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.630
machine learning models, but we'll cover

76
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.770
that when we get there. Now beyond the math

77
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.650
we also want to know a little bit about probability.

78
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.210
So we'll want to know basic probability, for instance

79
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.550
rolling a two on a six sided die would have the probability

80
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.480
of one out of six, that's because there's one way

81
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.730
to get a two out of all of the possible ways

82
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.040
that we can also roll the die.

83
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.350
So we could roll a one, a two or three or four and five

84
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.660
and a six, which gives us a probability of one over six.

85
00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.240
Now the probability of rolling two twos

86
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.160
with a pair of dice is just that multiplied

87
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.620
with itself because both of those have to happen.

88
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.410
We will be using the equivalent

89
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.920
of an end in the world of probability.

90
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.010
So rolling the first two was one out of six

91
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.899
and rolling a second two will take on the probability

92
00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:18.810
of 1 over 36. Now a little bit more in depth

93
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.590
on the probabilities. We'll want to know

94
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.950
conditional probabilities. So for instance,

95
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.460
the probability of drawing two hearts in a row from a deck

96
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.460
of cards would first begin with a 13 out of 52 chance.

97
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.570
That's because there are 13 hearts out of all 52 cards.

98
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.200
And then once we drew that card out

99
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.930
there's only 51 cards now, and 12 of those

100
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.670
are hearts that's because we already drew a heart.

101
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.980
So here, the probability of drawing two hearts

102
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.270
in a row would be 5.88%. Lastly, in probability,

103
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.350
we'll be talking about distributions.

104
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.530
So a very common distribution is the gaussian distribution.

105
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.020
An example of a Gaussian distribution would be

106
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.960
the heights in inches of a population.

107
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.190
So let's say the average would be 63 inches.

108
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.650
So that would be the most likely height for a person.

109
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.120
And then it will get less and less likely

110
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.680
for the height to be away from that average.

111
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.430
So here, the chance of being 60 inches tall is less likely

112
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.270
than being 63 inches tall. Another distribution

113
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.300
we'll be talking about is the uniform distribution.

114
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.010
When we talked about rolling a dice, every single number

115
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.860
on the dice had an equal probability of being landed on.

116
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.850
So in that case, it would be a uniform distribution

117
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.310
across all of the sides of the dice.

118
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.770
Lastly, we'll also be covering the beta distribution

119
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.560
and this is good if we want to model something

120
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.730
such as rates. So let's say that we wanted

121
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.720
to measure the conversion rate of some model.

122
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.450
Here, conversion rate just means, did they click on the ad?

123
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.690
Did they purchase a product? Did they view the video?

124
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.020
Things like that? This will help us understand better.

125
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.570
The actual conversion rate that we've measured so far.

126
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.010
So in this case, if we've measured

127
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.440
that half of our users clicked on a particular ad

128
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.060
then the conversion rate would most likely be 50%

129
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.170
but there's also a distribution around this 50% such

130
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.780
that it could less likely be, 75%

131
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.630
as the model continues to operate.

132
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.990
It could also less likely be 25% conversion rate

133
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.840
as the model continues to operate.

134
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.530
And we get down to extremely unlikely

135
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.520
for the conversion rate to be zero

136
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.750
or 100% based on the models performance so far.

137
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.530
We'll talk more about beta distributions once we get there

138
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.120
that's all that we'll need to know for now.

139
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.523
Let's go ahead and begin.
